      <p><strong>Memory</strong> is arguably an essential ingredient of general intelligence. The
Atkinson–Shiffrin memory model [1], categorizes memory into “working” and
“long-term” memory frameworks, besides an initial sensory register. <strong>Working
memory</strong> (WM) acts as a temporary and limited store of information to be used in
cognitive tasks that can be addressed with a small amount of steps. <strong>Long-term
memory</strong> (LTM) instead acts as a more permanent storage of information
previously “rehearsed”. We hypothesize that integrating some LTM mechanism
should address the issue of <strong>catastrophic forgetting</strong> commonly faced by
computational models capable of working memory. This is the phenomenon in which
the <strong>performance on previously learned tasks is compromised upon learning a new
task</strong>. We extend the biologically plausible working memory model AuGMEnT [2] by
integrating a LTM repetition-based thresholding mechanism. We analyse the
performance of our model with and without the LTM mechanism on two tasks learned
model performance differ from the non-LTM-enabled model in that their
performance in the original task does not drop upon learning a new task**.
This underlines the clear necessity of LT memory-like mechanisms for continual
learning, which is undeniably present in biological agents.</p>

<h2 id="tasks-considered">Tasks Considered</h2>

<p>We analyse the performance of our model with and without the LTM mechanism on
two tasks learned sequentially. We also compare to the performance of monkeys as
a measure of biological plausibility.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The first task is a saccade/anti-saccade task. In this task, agents first see
a blank screen, then a fixation mark appear, indicating whether it’s a anti
or pro saccade. Then another cue appear on left or right, determine whether
it’s a right or left saccade. Agents need to respond with correct saccade
direction.</li>
  <li>The second task is a delayed match-to-category task. Agents first see a
fixation mark, followed by the cue 1, then another fixation mark. After, cue
2 appears, and agents need to decide whether cue 2 matches cue 1 by
indicating with a left or right saccade.</li>
</ol>
